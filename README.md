# Predict_sellingprice
The price of a used car depends on several factors such as its brand, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, and ownership history. Accurately predicting the selling price can help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
-dataset containing various features of used cars along with their selling prices is provided.


OBJECTIVE-build a complete machine learning pipeline that:
1.Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features,
2.Splits the dataset into appropriate training and testing sets,
3.Trains multiple regression models to predict the selling price, and
4.Evaluates each model using both regression metrics (e.g., RÂ², MAE, MSE) and classification-style metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) by binning continuous target values into ranges.

The goal is to identify which model provides the most accurate and reliable predictions, while also demonstrating a clear and well-structured approach to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
